After read [this post](https://www.facebook.com/swhdavid/posts/1534121046650607:40), I felt the sadness of being a digital colony.

## Is Taiwan being colonized by other countries ?

In short, yes. Taiwan is being colonized by other countries in terms of digital economic. The following articles support this statement.

* Google Play, Taiwan Market ranks the 4th
* Facebook, how many hours people spent on Facebook by countries

Question:

Lots of Taiwanese move to US to work for big tech companies (ex: Google, MS, Apple, and Facebook ...). What's their feelings while
they realize they are working for someone who is colonizing their hometown ....
